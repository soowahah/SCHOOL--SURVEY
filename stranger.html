            <strong>Hello, Stranger! ,</strong>
            <p>
              I hope you're not upset or annoyed by this, and that this letter doesn't catch you too off guard. 😊<br />
              You probably don't know me, but I just want you to know that this little "gimmick" is my way of showing appreciation for you. 🙏 I’ve been waiting for the school year to end because I’m too shy to even think about possibly running into you in the hallway. 😅<br />
              Whatever you're thinking right now, yes, you're right. 😔 I have a crush on you and really admire you. Like I said, this letter is my way of saying thank you and showing appreciation. I wish we were classmates, but oh well—if you hadn’t transferred to the other section...<br />
              Joking! ANTEEH ANG AKWARD!<br />
              We don’t really know each other, but I guess I’ve just been trying to get your attention a bit. 😅 HAHA, remember when I messaged you about the attendance? I really didn’t have to, but I just did it for fun. 😂 Also, about the exhibit, I knew you didn’t have a ticket, but I was too shy to offer it to you! 😅😂<br />
              OMG, I really hope this doesn't come across as weird. I just wanted to say thank you for the small interactions we’ve had. 🙌 I don’t know your situation right now, and honestly, I’m too shy to find out. 😆<br />
              I’m not expecting anything at all. I just wanted you to know that I appreciate you, Stranger! 😄 HAHA! I hope to see you next school year! I’m too shy to say it in person, so… thank you so much! 💖
            </p>
            <p>Yours always,<br />Me</p>
